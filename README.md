1. using a time series data set, creating a python injestion program to read data from the CSV file where it takes the whole file and writes it to influxDB using Docker. data is then queried from grafana dashboard where client can access the files.
2. Python injestion scriptS is used to query data from weather API where data is now sent to influxDB and grafana dashboard for clients to be able to view/access data.

# Conclusion
This project is good for getting data
